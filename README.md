# AIPAL Validator

AIPAL Validator is a tool designed to streamline the validation process for [AIPAL](https://github.com/VincentAlcazer/AIPAL). Below you'll find instructions on how to set up and run this validator both locally and with Docker.

> **Note**: This README provides comprehensive documentation for the AIPAL validation pipeline. It covers local setup, Docker deployment, data import processes, outlier detection, and model retraining capabilities. For synthetic data testing, see the `synthetic_test_data/README.md` file for specific instructions.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- **R Installation**: Ensure R is installed on your system. If not, install it using:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install r-base
  ```

  Also ensure to install the following packages within R: 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'yaml', 'caret', 'xgboost'

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

2. Run the validation process. You can specify the step to run (all, data, sampling, test):

    ```bash
    poetry run aipal_validation --task aipal --step [all,data,sampling,test]
    ```

## Docker Setup

1. Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker compose run aipal bash
    ```

2. Inside the Docker container, execute the validation script:

    ```bash
    python -m aipal_validation --task aipal --step [all,data,sampling,test]
    ```

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `aipal_validation/`: Main package containing all functionality
  - `r/`: Contains all R scripts for prediction and model training (moved from root directory)
  - `config/`: Configuration files
  - `data_preprocessing/`: Data preprocessing modules
  - `eval/`: Evaluation modules
  - `fhir/`: FHIR-related modules
  - `ml/`: Machine learning modules
  - `outlier/`: Outlier detection modules
  - `helper/`: Utility functions

# Importing Data from Excel

To import data from an Excel sheet for analysis, follow these steps:

## Steps to Import Data

1. **Set the `run_id`:**
   - Update the `run_id` to match your cohort name.

2. **Prepare Your Directory:**
   - In your `root_dir`, create a folder named after your cohort.
   - Inside this folder, create another folder named `aipal`.
   - Place your Excel sheet in the `aipal` folder.

3. **Generate Custom Samples:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python -m aipal_validation --task aipal --step sampling
     ```
   - This command invokes the `generate_custom_samples.py` class.
   - Ensure the column names in your Excel file exactly match the expected names in the script.
   - Alternatively, perform necessary data transformations within the script.

4. **Run the Validation Pipeline:**
   - Once the `samples.csv` file is successfully created, execute the following command to run the validation pipeline:
     ```bash
     python -m aipal_validation --task aipal --step test
     ```

# Outlier Detection

To run outlier detection on your dataset and identify potential anomalies:

1. **Local Setup:**
   ```bash
   poetry run aipal_validation --task outlier --step detect
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:**
   ```bash
   docker compose run aipal bash
   python -m aipal_validation --task outlier --step detect
   ```

The outlier detection uses isolation forest and local outlier factor (LOF) algorithms to identify samples that deviate significantly from the expected patterns in each class.

# Model Retraining (on pediatric subset)

To retrain the AIPAL model with your dataset:

1. **Local Setup:**
   ```bash
   poetry run aipal_validation --task retrain --step all
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:**
   ```bash
   docker compose run aipal bash
   python -m aipal_validation --task retrain --step all
   ```

The retraining process will:
- Split your data into training and testing sets
- Train an XGBoost model on the pediatric subset (age < 18)
- Save the retrained model and prediction outputs to the `aipal_validation/r/` directory
- Perform evaluation on the test set
